# SudoQ
A Sudoku solver that leverages D-Wave's Quantum Computer.
Meant to be a first project, a tutorial of sorts for Quantum Annealing using D-Wave architecture. Addresses QUBO set-up and solving.  

Includes code and a presentation explaining it. Presented them at PyData and Persistent Systems, in Pune on 27th July 2019.
